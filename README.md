# Machine-Learning-Library
Java library of several Machine Learning algorithms.
Will add Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (C4.5), Random Forest, SVM (linear and non-linear), as well as clustering algorithms (k-means).

##TODO
NB: add support for continuous variables (Gaussian)

DecTree: add missing value support, add gini index and infoGain ratio, continuous features
implement C5.0 instead of C4.5? more memory efficient, better performance

K-means, hierarchical, DBScan + optimizations
